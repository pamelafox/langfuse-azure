# Deploy langfuse to Azure - WIP

Use the Azure Developer CLI to deploy langfuse to Azure. The following steps will guide you through the process.

Run:

```shell
azd up
```

## TODO:

1. Use Key Vault for secrets
2. See if we can specify password separately and store in ACA secrets, not env vars.
3. Bring in AAD authentication optionally
4. Document how to use in azure-search-openai-demo
